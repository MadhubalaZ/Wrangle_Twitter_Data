# Wrangle Twitter Data Findings
## Introduction:
In this project data is gathered from three different sources: twitter data archive, udacity server, and twitter API. This gathered data is then merged together and accessed for cleaning. Necessary cleaning operations are performed. Finally exploratory data visualizations are produced to explore the cleaned data.

## Data Visualization Findings:
1. A box plot was created to observe the minimum, maximum and mean ratings for all dog ratings. And it was observed that min rating was 0, max was 14 and mean was 12
2. After grouping the data by type of dog breed and counting the number of dog, a bar plot was created to visualize the dog breed and its corresponding count of dogs.
3. Also, first 10 dog breed with highest count were plotted. And it was observed that golden_retrriever has highest count of dogs
4. After grouping the data by type of dog breed and summing the dog ratings, a bar plot was created to visualize the dog breed and its corresponding sum of ratings.
5. Pie chart was created to visualize top 10 highest summed ratings of dogs. And was observed that golden_retriever has highest summed rating
6. A scatter plot was created to visualize the relationship between Dog rating and Count varibles. And was observed that there is a strong positive relationship, as the count increases so does the summed dog ratings.
7. As there is positive relationship between count and summed rating, I thought we should consider mean rating. So, data was grouped by dog type and mean of its corresponding ratings was stored and plotted.
8. A boxplot was created to visualize the minimum mean, maximum mean and average mean rating for dog type. And it was observed that min mean is 9, max mean is 14 and avg mean is 12.
9. Lastly a scatter plot was created to visualize the relationship between mean rating and dog type count, and it was observed that there is a weak positive relationship.
