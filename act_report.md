# Wrangle Twitter Data Findings
## Introduction:
In this project data is gathered from three different sources: twitter data archive, udacity server, and twitter API. This gathered data is then merged together and accessed for cleaning. Necessary cleaning operations are performed. Finally exploratory data visualizations are produced to explore the cleaned data.

## Data Visualization Findings:
1.) A box plot was created to observe the minimum, maximum and mean ratings for all dog ratings. And it was observed that min rating was 0, and mean rating was 12

2.) After grouping the data by type of dog breed and counting the number of dog, a bar plot was created to visualize the dog breed and its corresponding count of dogs. And it was observed that golden_retrriever has highest count of dogs

3.) After grouping the data by type of dog breed and summing the dog ratings, a bar plot was created to visualize the dog breed and its corresponding sum of ratings. And it was observed that golden_retrriever has highest summed ratings of dog

4.) A scatter plot was created to visualize the relationship between Dog rating and Count varibles. And was observed that there is a strong positive relationship, as the count increases so does the summed dog ratings.

5.) As there is positive relationship between count and summed rating, mean rating were considered. So, data was grouped by dog type and mean of its corresponding ratings were plotted. And it was observed that though golden_retriever had highest count and summed rating, hightest mean rating was given to Pekinese

6.) Data was grouped by date of tweets and its tweet_id count was plotted as a line plot, and it was observed that highest tweets were reported during 2015-12 to 2016-02
